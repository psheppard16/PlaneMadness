# PlaneMadness
My most advanced Java project; a Galaga style plane game where the player attempts to beat progressively harder levels as they upgrade their ship. While I made this many years ago, I remember being quite pleased with the elegance of the code, especially how easy it was to make new levels. However, I doubt it holds up to my current standards.
